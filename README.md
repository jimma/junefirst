JuneFirst
================================
This the project for intern to familiar with git, maven and eclipse editor to see what's the process to contribute to opensource. This requires interns to finish the follow things : 
* Create a maven project 
* This project is a web application with a servlet to display JuneFirst when access http://localhost:8080/junefirst
* The war file should be built when run mvn clean install, then deploy to wildfly to server the request
* Run the whole thing with maven would be great.
* Research to use other framework to test servlet would be great.
