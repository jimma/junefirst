# junefirst
This the project for intern to familiar with git, maven and eclipse editor to see what's the process to contribute to opensource. This requires interns to finish the follow things : 
1. Create a maven project 
2. This project is a web application with a servlet to display JuneFirst when access http://localhost:8080/junefirst
3. The war file should be built when run mvn clean install, then deploy to wildfly to server the request
4. Run the whole thing with maven would be great.
5. Research to use other framework to test servlet would be great.
